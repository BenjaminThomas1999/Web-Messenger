This is a web-based messaging client that is written in PHP and Javascript. This initial version uses a flat file database to store the messages. Messages are automatically displayed on the screen when new entries are added into the database file, this is done through ajax. There is also a users flat file database which stores Usernames and IDs.

Here is a example of the whole system working together: http://82.13.39.239/projects/messenger/
Please note that the UI is designed for a mobile interface, you can resize your browser window to accomodate for this if you so wish.
